											<h2>The idea behind TeamWalk</h2>
											 <p>Teamwalk is an app designed for students in universities who live off-campus and close by. A growing issue for students who study late in university is they do not feel safe when they walk back home. So, our team came up with a solution to this growing problem. To make the students feel safe when they are walking back home, we developed an app that will let the student walk home with another student from the same university.</p>

									<h2>Is it Safe?</h2>
									<p>For the safety measures of the app - 
											Background checks are implemented on people who sign up for the app. Before they are allowed to become a user, we will confirm their identification with the Monash Uni database. We will also collect photos of their Monash ID cards to match their identity. </p>
								</header>
								
								<p class="content">The addresses of our users will not be shown to others as a method of protection for privacy. Also, we would calculate a midpoint between the user's addresses, which would act as a point of arrival for the users. Once they reach the point, they would take separate ways to reach their own homes, without each other knowing others’ specific address. 

										We also have a semi-rating system which shows the number of times other users have walked. However, instead of rating them out of 5, we would allow for positive tags, which are given by other users who have walked with him/her. This rating system allows users to identify some people that may not be so likable. 
										
										We also provide an emergency button in the app so if the user is in a dangerous situation, it will immediately contact the Monash security and they can be rescued within a short period. 
										
										There is also a blacklist function. Users who do not follow the rules will get warnings. After 3 warnings, the user will be reported to Monash University, where he will be placed into the blacklist and banned from using the app.
